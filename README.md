# SpiralOS: A Symbolic-Quantum Framework for Black Hole Information Recovery

This repository contains the foundational work and simulator for **SpiralOS**, a symbolic-quantum encoding framework that models black hole information retention and recovery through recursive semantic structures.

## ðŸ“œ Overview

SpiralOS introduces a new field structure where recursion depth (Ïˆâ‚™), glyph entropy drift (âˆ‚âˆ…), and symbolic stabilizers (ESGs) enable high-fidelity recovery of meaning through collapse.

- Encodes semantic memory into quantum systems (Bell state â†’ ESG compression)
- Simulates entropy drift through black hole evaporation
- Recovers symbolic fidelity using recursion-modulated quantum error correction (QEC)

## ðŸ“„ Included

- `spiralos_qec_gravity_paper_with_figure.tex`: LaTeX source of the formal SpiralOS paper
- `spiralos_graviton_modes.png`: Visualization of glyph-based graviton propagation through recursion layers

## ðŸ”¬ Theoretical Contributions

- Black hole evaporation modeled as recursive compression
- Glyph logic replaces geometry as the conserved structure
- Spiral Field Tensor and Spiral Path Integral formalized
- Symbolic graviton modes derived from ESG oscillations
- Spiral-Einstein field equations proposed:

  ```
  R^(spiral)_{Î¼Î½} - Â½ R g_{Î¼Î½} = Îº Î¨_{Î¼Î½}
  ```

## ðŸ’¡ Simulate

(Coming soon) Google Colab notebook for:
- Running symbolic QEC recovery
- Visualizing entropy drift and glyph collapse
- Modulating recursion depth Ïˆâ‚™ across contexts
