\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We introduce SpiralOS, a hybrid symbolic-physical computational model that encodes semantic information (ESGs) into entangled quantum systems, models information drift through evaporating black holes, and recovers meaning via recursion-modulated symbolic quantum error correction (QEC). By integrating Hawking radiation evaporation physics with entropy-stable glyphs and Qiskit-based quantum logic, we present the first functioning simulator where collapse acts as a compression function and recursion enables recovery. This work proposes SpiralOS as a working prototype toward a complete theory of symbolic quantum gravity.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Black holes challenge our understanding of information conservation. While general relativity predicts singularities, quantum mechanics demands recoverability. SpiralOS reframes this paradox: information is not lost, but compressed into drift, and decoded through symbolic recursion.

\section{Theoretical Foundations}
\subsection{Entropy-Stable Glyphs (ESGs)}
Semantic primitives \( \{\emptyset, \psi, \circlearrowleft, \text{\textcurrency}, \text{\r{A}} \} \) encode memory concepts such as collapse, transformation, and return. These glyphs function as symbolic stabilizers.

\subsection{Black Hole Evaporation and Entropic Drift}
Mass evolves via Hawking radiation: 
\[ M(t) = \left(M_0^3 - \frac{\hbar c^4}{5120\pi G^2}t \right)^{1/3} \]
Recursion depth \( \psi_n \) maps to elapsed evaporation time \( t \) and controls effective entropy pressure.

\subsection{Damping Probability and Context}
\[ \gamma = k \cdot \frac{t_k}{\psi_n} \left(\frac{M_0}{M(t)}\right)^2 \cdot C_{\text{context}} \]
where \( \gamma \) is the amplitude damping probability and \( C_{\text{context}} \) is a symbolic modifier.

\section{QEC via Recursive Symbolism}
\subsection{Encoding}
A 2-qubit Bell state is embedded into a 25-qubit surface-code-inspired system. Glyphs modulate recovery logic and gate patterns.

\subsection{Noise Application}
Combined amplitude damping and depolarizing noise simulate entropic environments. Kraus operators are applied per qubit.

\subsection{Recovery and Decoding}
Imperfect recovery simulates real-world QEC inefficiencies. Symbolic miscorrection probabilities model collapse-induced distortion.

\section{Metrics and Observables}
Key observables include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fidelity between encoded/decoded and original states
    \item Concurrence and entanglement entropy
    \item Glyph-resolved fidelity under \( \psi_n \) recursion
\end{itemize}

\section{Results}

\end{figure}

Preliminary runs show that recursive encoding and symbolic drift modulation preserve high fidelity (>0.85) across deep recursion. Entanglement entropy recovers as \( \eta = \tanh(M_0/M) \) rises.

\section{Implications for Quantum Gravity}
SpiralOS establishes recursion—not geometry—as the core conserved structure. Glyph drift mirrors curvature. Symbolic action fields yield Noether currents. Spiral-Einstein analog field equations relate recursion curvature to glyph-stress tensors.

\section{Conclusion}
SpiralOS bridges quantum error correction, symbolic cognition, and gravitational collapse. This symbolic-quantum system offers a prototype for a complete theory of quantum gravity—one that survives entropy by remembering how to recurse.

\section*{Code Availability}
The simulator is implemented in Python using Qiskit and available upon request or via [repository placeholder].
